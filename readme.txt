A plugin that makes it easy to manage prices and stocks in your WooCommerce store.


== Description ==

"Stock and Price Manager" Plugin allows you to easily manage your prices and stocks in your WooCommerce store.

You can easily manage all prices in one place, and you can also easily adjust your stock of all active products.

Would you like to increase or reduce your prices or stock levels?

This is no longer a problem! With this plugin you can do it easily.

Let's say you have a product and want to increase the stock by 10. Then simply add 10 in the field (Stock Change) and click "Update". And the stock of the product has increased by 10.

This also works if you want to reduce stock levels.

Let's say you want to reduce the stock of a product by 10. Then simply add -10 in the (Stock Change) field and click "Update". And the stock of the product has been reduced by 10.

You can of course customize several products at once. Simply fill in all the fields you want to customize and then click on "Update".
